# -World_Weather_Analysis-
  In this analysis we are adding the weather description to the weather data already analyzed in the module. We will filter weather preferences of potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Once this is done we will choose four cities, and create a travel itinerary, and use goold maps to input the travel route amongst the cities along with marker layer maps showing the hotels, City County, and current weather.
